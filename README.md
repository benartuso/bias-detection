# bias-detection
This repository was created as a final project for the CS4501 (Natural Language Processing for Deep Learning), and uses a variety of techniques to detect subjective bias in text. 

This project was inspired by (and our models were trained using) the Wiki Neutrality Corpus (WNC), created by Pryzant, Martinez, Dass, Kurohashi, Jurafsky, and Yang (2019), available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09709.
